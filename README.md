# D-Tree-Android-App

Introducing D-TreeAPI - a straightforward REST application that retrieves data from a restdb.io database. 

By clicking on the "Get Data" button, users can access the full list of items stored in the database. 

Additionally, the app allows users to filter the results based on the city field. 
If the user enters a city that is not present in the database, a pop-up notification appears, highlighting the discrepancy and suggesting available cities. 
This feature ensures that users can easily find the data they need without encountering errors or confusion.
